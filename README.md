# Artificial-Neural-Network-Class
My own implementation of an Artificial Neural Network class.

Things still needed to implement:

- saveWeights and loadWeights functions.

- Return loss in evaluation method.

- Implement a crossover function for weights and biases for use in genetic algorithm.

- Implement a mutation function to mutate the weights and biases for use in genetic algorithms.

- Implement other activation functions.

- Add additional loss functions. 

- Note add something to deal with undersampled classes in data, or this is to be done before it is passed to the neural network.

- Fix relu activation function.
